You will be implementing the State Design Pattern to create a package delivery program.

State Abstract Base Class
Has three abstract methods methods: getStatus, getETA, and delay

getVerb(String singular, String plural), this method can be used like:

getVerb("is", "are") if the quantity is 1 it would return "is", if it is greater than 1 it will return "are"

This is used to avoid the / in the output, so if you see was/were, you would be calling this method.

OrderedState
days attribute is initially set to 2

getStatus returns: The <package name> was/were ordered

getETA returns: The <package name> will be shipped within DAYS business days

delay: increments the days variable by 2

returns: The <package name> experienced a slight delay in manufacturing. 

 The <package name> will be shipped within DAYS business days

InTransitState
days attribute is initially set to 5

getStatus returns: The <package name> is/are out for delivery

getETA returns: The <package name> should arrive within DAYS days

delay: increments the days variable by 3

returns: The <package name>  has/have experienced a delay in shipping. 

The <package name> should arrive within DAYS days



DeliveredState
getStatus returns: The <package name> is/are here for you

getETA returns: The <package name> is/are here

delay: The <package name> has/have already been delivered



Package

order(): set the state, returns the status and eta

mail(): set the state, returns the status and eta

received(): set the state returns the status
